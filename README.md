The Report of the project can be seen here (ADD LINK AFTER DONE)

## Description
The purpose of the project was to achieve and develop a super-resolution model based on a Hierarchical VAE, here the [Ladder VAE](https://github.com/addtt/ladder-vae-pytorch) implementation was used to build upon it.

The Project has three parts, those showing the progress up to the hierarchical VAE, those parts being a SR-CNN implementation, a SR-VAE model, and finally the SR-LVAE model.

## Usage
To run any of the three models, the Operational IPytthon Notebooks can be run, each for their individual model.
